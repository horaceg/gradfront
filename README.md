# Interactive gradient descent

A small interactive visualization to understand the way gradient descent work for simple use cases.

Svelte is used for the front-end, Pancake for the charts and Tensorflow JS for machine learning.

See the [blog post](https://horaceguy.pages.dev/need-for-speed) for context around the creation process.
